# Start learn pentesting. Red Team

```diff
- !!! Always do all work from VM or dedicated machine for that, remember that all tools that you install may have some 
- viruses, trojans, etc(mostly not but risk exists). 
- So you shoul prevent them to access your real machine with you secure data. !!!

- Also dont forget to use VPN, even when using training vm from hackthebox(cause u will be sharing same network with many people)
